# AutoColliderGenerator for Unity

Automatically generates simple colliders (Box, Sphere, or Capsule) for a 3D model's children based on mesh bounds.

## Features

- Adds **BoxCollider**, **SphereCollider**, or **CapsuleCollider** depending on mesh shape.
- Skips GameObjects that already have colliders.
- Tags generated colliders to allow easy removal.
- Editor buttons to:
  - Generate colliders.
  - Remove generated colliders.
  - Toggle preview of potential colliders in the Scene view (Gizmos).
- Clean and recursive handling of nested objects.

## How to Use

1. Attach the `AutoColliderGenerator` script to the root of your model or GameObject hierarchy.
2. In the **Inspector**, use the following buttons:
   - `Generate Colliders`: Adds appropriate colliders to children without affecting existing ones.
   - `Remove Generated Colliders`: Removes only the colliders generated by this script.
   - `Preview Colliders`: Toggle to visualize potential colliders using Gizmos.
3. Customize logic inside `AutoColliderGenerator.cs` if needed.

## Installation

1. Copy the `AutoColliders` folder into your Unity project's `Assets/` directory.
2. Or import the `.unitypackage` version via `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package`.

## Notes

- Capsule detection is based on size ratio (e.g., one dimension significantly larger).
- Sphere detection assumes roughly equal dimensions.
- Previews are drawn using the Gizmos API when the GameObject is selected.
